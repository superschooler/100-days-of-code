# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 9, 2022

It's time for me to seriously look at a career change, and coding is a top prospect. Landing a job in web development, software development, or data analytics seems far-fetched for a guy with a criminal justice degree, background in mortgage sales, and limited coding knowledge. So, my goal with this 100-day challenge is to see how I feel about coding after 100+ hours of consistent learning and practice, as well as get my name and experience in front of people in the industry who may be able to help me land a job. 

The #100daysofcode rules are simple:
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

I'll need a bit of grace with rule #1 in July since I'm getting married and will be out of town for a couple of weeks. Nothing says "thanks for marrying me" like spending your honeymoon on a laptop learning to code.

Because I wanted to get started now, I'm going to begin tracking my progress and adhering as close to the rules as possible, while still making sure I'm prepared for the wedding.


I'm going to begin learning via freeCodeCamp.com since it's a free resource. I've used it and Codecademy in the past and am definitely a bigger fan of Codecademy, but don't want to spend money on it at the moment. I also have Jon Duckett's books on HTML & CSS and Javascript & JQuery, and plan to use them both as resources, along with any other online resources I stumble across.

In the past, I've learned HTML & CSS fairly well but always get stumped on JavaScript. To combat this, I plan to practice as much as possible and go above and beyond any example exercises I'm given to really cement the knowledge.

Here's to coding!

### Day 1: June 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed freeCodeCamp's Cafe Menu and Colored Markers modules - coded for about 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to learn more about CSS - I've never considered myself an overly creatve person and have struggled with intermediate/advanced CSS in the past. Looking forward at some of the projects it seems like I'll quickly become an expert in CSS through this course. The cafe menu exercise was easy for me and the colored markers exercise was interesting to work through and learn about gradients, how colors work (hsl vs rgb vs hex), and see a neat finished project.

### Day 2: June 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished registration form project from freeCodeCamp, finished survey form solo project

**Thoughts**: There's a lot involved to CSS, it took a long time remembering all the specifics, like box displays, formatting forms properly, etc. It took me a little while to get the form just right in HTML too, but I used Jon Duckett's book HTML & CSS as a great resource so I wasn't just copying code off other forms.
